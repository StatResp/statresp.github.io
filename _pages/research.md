The key components of an ERM pipeline are: (1) *Incident forecasting* -- understanding where and when incidents occur , (2) *Long-term resource allocation* -- strategic decisions on long-term resource place- ment, such as how many stations and vehicles to acquire and where to build said stations , (3) *Dynamic resource allocation* -- short term operational decisions such as rebalancing vehicle allocations based on current demands , and (4) *Dispatching* -- policy for deploying responders when an incident is reported.

Designing pipelines for emergency response is challenging. Despite the dynamic and uncertain environment in which ERM evolves, response must be effective and efficient. Our research has spanned all the three components of the ERM pipeline. 

1. Forecasting Methods -- Summarize Forecasting, Clustering and Visualization.

2. Allocation Methods -- Summarize AAMAS_17 and AAMAS_18.

3. Dispatch Methods -- Summarize AAMAS_18, ICCPS_19, AAMAS_20.

<!-- The problem is challenging because the correct answer may not only depend upon just sending the nearest emergency responder, but sometimes it may also require proactively placing emergency vehicles in regions with higher incident likelihood. Sending the nearest available responder by euclidean distance ignores road networks and their congestion, as well as where the resources are stationed. Greedily assigning resources to incidents can lead to resources being pulled away from their stations, increasing response times if an incident occurs in the future in the area where responder should be positioned. The goal of this project is to enable an ERM pipeline that solves these problem strategically.  -->
