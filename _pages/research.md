<p>The key components of an ERM pipeline are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incident Forecasting: creating models to understand where and when incidents occur, and with what severity.</li>
<li>Long-term resource allocation: creating algorithmic approaches to station resources in the anticipation of future incidents.</li>
<li>Short-term dynamic allocation: updating responder allocation to adjust to the changing dynamics of urban areas.</li>
<li>Dispatch: creating principled approaches to dispatching responders</li>
</ul>
<p>Designing ERM pipelines is challenging. Despite the dynamic and uncertain environments in which ERM systems work, response is expected to be efficient and effective. Our research has spanned all the four components in the last few years. We present a short summary of our work here.</p>


1. Forecasting Methods -- Summarize Forecasting, Clustering and Visualization.

2. Allocation Methods -- Summarize AAMAS_17 and AAMAS_18.

3. Dispatch Methods -- Summarize AAMAS_18, ICCPS_19, AAMAS_20.

<!-- The problem is challenging because the correct answer may not only depend upon just sending the nearest emergency responder, but sometimes it may also require proactively placing emergency vehicles in regions with higher incident likelihood. Sending the nearest available responder by euclidean distance ignores road networks and their congestion, as well as where the resources are stationed. Greedily assigning resources to incidents can lead to resources being pulled away from their stations, increasing response times if an incident occurs in the future in the area where responder should be positioned. The goal of this project is to enable an ERM pipeline that solves these problem strategically.  -->
