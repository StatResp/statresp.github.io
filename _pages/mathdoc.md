<b>Data</b>

We assume the availability of a set of samples (possibly noisy) of historical incidents, which we refer to as \(D\), and can be represented as a vector of tuples \(\{(s_1,t_1,k_1,w_1),(s_2,t_2,k_2,w_2),\dots,(s_n,t_n,k_n,w_n)\}\), where \(s_i\), \(t_i\) and \(k_i\) denote the location, time of occurrence, and reported severity of the \(i\)th incident, respectively, and \(w \in \mathbb{R}^m\) represents a vector of features associated with the incident.
