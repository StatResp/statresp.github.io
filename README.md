# Statistical Methods to Incident Response

Emergency response management (ERM) is a critical problem faced by communities across the globe. First-responders are constrained by limited resources, and must attend to different types of incidents like traffic accidents, fires, crime, and distress calls. Incident response is further complicated by the constraint that quick and timely service is essential. As a consequence, statistical and algorithmic approaches to emergency response have received significant attention in the last few decades. Governments in urban areas are increasingly adopting methods that enable Smart Statistical Emergency Response, which are a combination of forecasting models and visualization tools to understand where and when incidents occur, and optimization approaches to allocate and dispatch responders. This is the basis of this project.

The most crucial component of an ERM pipeline is to understand where, when and how incidents occur. This tool is a collection of forecasting, clustering and visualization methods accompanied by a set of statistical tools to help first-responders understand the dynamics of incident occurrence. We have worked on emergency response for the last six years and analyzed problems and algorithmic bottlenecks that affect this field. This tool incorporates our work, as well as that of several other researchers who have worked on these problems for decades. To understand the broader methodology behind our tool, please refer to the following [overview paper](overview.pdf). The github repository includes a folder named documentation that consists the mathematical details behind the methods. 

We also include a case study with this tool, courtesy of our collaborators at the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) and the Nashville Fire Department (NFD).
