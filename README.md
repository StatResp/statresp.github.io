# Statistical Incident Response Management Pipelines

Emergency response management (ERM) is a critical problem faced by communities across the globe. First-responders are constrained by limited resources, and must attend to different types of incidents like traffic accidents, fires, crime, and distress calls. Incident response is further complicated by the constraint that quick and timely service is essential. As a consequence, statistical and algorithmic approaches to emergency response have received significant attention in the last few decades. Governments in urban areas are increasingly adopting methods that enable Smart Statistical Emergency Response, which are a combination of forecasting models and visualization tools to understand where and when incidents occur, and optimization approaches to allocate and dispatch responders. This is the basis of this project.

 The key components of an ERM pipeline are: (1) *Incident forecasting* -- understanding where and when incidents occur , (2) *Long-term
 resource allocation* -- strategic decisions on long-term resource
 place- ment, such as how many stations and vehicles to acquire and
 where to build said stations , (3) *Dynamic resource allocation* --
 short term operational decisions such as rebalancing vehicle
 allocations based on current demands , and (4) *Dispatching* -- policy
 for deploying responders when an incident is reported.
 
 With our collaborators at Tennessee Department of Transportation (focusing on incident response on state highways) and Nashville fire department (focusing on incident response in urban communities) this project is developing an online incident forecasting and algorithmic approaches to  decentralized multi-agent response that focuses on resource allocation and dispatching policies.
